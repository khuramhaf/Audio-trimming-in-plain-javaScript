# Audio-trimming-in-plain-javaScript
This is a simple audio trimming application built using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It trims the first 10 seconds of an audio file and allows the user to record and download the trimmed audio. The user can run the app locally by using the server.js file and accessing it at localhost:3000. The trimming is done using channel data and the trimming values are hardcoded. The app automatically starts recording after the "cut" button is clicked and stops recording when the "stop" button is clicked.
